    **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
    
    **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 3: April 13, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Javascript review. Always good to recap the basics every so often. Also reviewed Git generally and specifically history, configuration, rebase, pruning history

**Thoughts** Looked into Bash Academy. 11 chapters, 11 days? 

**Links**
1. [The Bash Guide](http://guide.bash.academy/)


### Day 2: April 11, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Restarted my Exercism.io (Python/JS)challenges....Totally forgot about those....Also found a better notebook for GIT/BASH notes. Transferring....

**Thoughts** Using C9 for consistency sake...setting up was a pain. Would like to look back into Bash Academy. Will look into FCC tomorrow.

### Day 1: April 10, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started digging back into React starting at the beginning, going over fuzzy concepts

**Thoughts** Using a Meteor.js + React Tut in combination with a few other React YT series and Tyler McGinnis's React Training. Still wondering if I need Meteor.....
