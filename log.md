    **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
    
    **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Thoughts** I wish FCC made it so the challenges already completed in the alpha curriculum were marked as complete in the beta.
Doing EVERYTHING all over again is a major drag, just to get to the content I want. Or a way to test out would be nice. 
Would it be too much to ask for your progress to be downloadable or backable to github? 
Save as a Gist? Add to a repo? I could do this manually, (I started to do this with the alpha curriculum) - but is a pain to start over with beta.
And then having to redo everytime FCC changes it curriculum? - hell to the naw.
